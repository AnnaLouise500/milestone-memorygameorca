Memory Game for Orca Raffle - Milestone Project 2 for FSD Course

## Who are Orca Raffle?
<ul>
<li>Orca Raffle is the brain child of James and Piers, childhood school friends who wanted to create a platform which contributes to generating revenue for a number of different charities</li>
<li>The site works by procuring donated prizes such as iPhones, Xbox consoles etc and allowing their customers to buy tickets in the 
chance of winning.</li>
<li>They draw the winner by picking a number at random, live on their website.</li> 
<li>To limit the amount of people entering the raffle they have come up with the idea of creating a game which will load just after a customer has paid for their tickets</li>
<li>If the customer does not pass the game, they will not be entered into the prize draw</li>

## Requirements
<li>The pass rate of this game needs to be less than 85%</li>
<li>The game needs to be of a kind where the customer cannot Google the answer and cheat to pass</li>
<li>The game needs to not exclude any customer demographic e.g. sound based game without visual guidance excludes people with hearing
difficulties </li>
<li>The game needs to take less than 2 minutes to complete</li>
<li>The game needs to be fun and engaging to encourage customers to complete all levels</li>
<li>The owners need to be able to capture the number of poeple clicking "Begin" vs the number of people clicking "Enter Into Draw"
to ensure the 85% pass rate is adhered to as they can be audited</li>
<li>The game needs to scale from mobile to desktop, whilst ensuring on a small mobile device that the memory tiles are still easy to
click (the neighbouring one doesn't get clicked accidentally instead)</li>
<li>The game needs to be well explained on the Homepage to ensure customers know how to play before beginning</li>
<li>The customer needs to be able to return to the main website at any point during the game</li>
<li>We need to look at making the memory combinations different everytime a customer attempts to pass. Otherwise they can just repeat
the same combination until they pass</li>
<li>Client branding needs to be present on the screen at all times</li>
<li>The UI colour scheme needs to be obvious (red for wrong, tick for correct etc.)</li>
<li>The difficulty level of the game needs to be easily ammended (based off a trial to see what the initial pass rate is like)</li>
<li>Game load time needs to be short and punchy so as not to put customers off with waiting to load</li>
<li>Prompt to show that the game is loading when customer has bad connectivity</li>
